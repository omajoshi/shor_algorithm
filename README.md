# Shor's Algorithm Simulator, designed by Om Joshi

`shor_algorithm.m` - originally written in Matlab. I presented this project as part of an interview with Intel.


`shor_algorithm.py` - I later ported it to Python, in order to refamiliarize myself with Numpy. I also made some small upgrades, including simulating measurements using `np.random.choice`.


Thanks to Parth Shroff for helping test the Matlab program.
